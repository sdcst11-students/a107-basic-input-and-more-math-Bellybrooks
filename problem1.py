# Canada Income Tax Calculator part I

'''
It's tax season!  Nobody loves doing taxes, so EVERYONE uses computers to help them.  We will use
Python to determine Federal and Provincial Income Tax.

The Canadian income tax system is a tiered system, which means you pay different percentages of
your income for different parts of your income.
You pay 15% tax on the first 49020 you earn.  If you earn more than this amount, you pay
20.5% on amounts over 49020 that are less than 98040
26% on amounts over 98040 but less than 151978
29% on amounts over 151978 but less than 216511
33% on amounts over 216511

Write a program to calculate the amount of Federal Income Tax for people who earn over 100,000 but less than 150,000

Example:
Enter your income: 125000
Your federal income tax is: 24411.7
